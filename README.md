**Overview:**

Tree Scanner is a comprehensive mobile solution designed for tree species identification and plant disease detection. With the increasing need for plant health monitoring and species identification, this application simplifies the process by analyzing leaf images and providing accurate results in seconds. Whether it's identifying an unfamiliar plant species or diagnosing a disease in crops, Tree Scanner caters to a wide audience, including farmers, researchers, and hobbyists.

The application utilizes a robust backend powered by deep learning models such as ResNet for disease prediction and species identification. Users upload an image of a leaf, and the app processes it through the model to generate predictions. Additionally, it ensures the accuracy and usability of results by detecting invalid inputs, such as non-leaf images, and notifying users with appropriate error messages.

**Project Goals:**

Provide accurate species identification and plant disease detection.
Implement a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
Ensure the model detects and notifies users of invalid or non-leaf image uploads.
Compare and evaluate machine learning algorithms for optimal performance in disease detection.
Data Source
The models are trained using datasets comprising plant leaves and labeled with species and disease categories. These datasets include high-quality images of healthy and diseased leaves, sourced from publicly available repositories like Kaggle and plant pathology datasets.

**Dataset Highlights:**

Thousands of labeled leaf images.
Categories include species and disease labels.
Data preprocessed and augmented for improved model generalization.
Algorithms and Models

**ResNet-9 Architecture:**

Used for disease detection.
Processes input images and provides probabilities and disease labels.
**Llama API Integration:**

Provides detailed species identification through text-based results.
Analyzes image context for accurate predictions.

**Future Work:**

Expand the database to include more plant species and diseases.
Enhance the mobile app with real-time scanning features using AR (Augmented Reality).
Integrate geotagging to provide region-specific plant insights.
Collaborate with agricultural and botanical organizations for live data updates.
Conclusion
Tree Scanner bridges the gap between technology and nature by offering a cutting-edge solution for plant disease detection and species identification. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, it empowers users with knowledge about plant health, fostering biodiversity and sustainable practices. The project sets a foundation for future innovations in agriculture, conservation, and environmental science.
